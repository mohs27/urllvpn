# Censor Dodge Web Proxy

**Current Stable Release:** V1.83

[Censor Dodge](https://censordodge.com/) is a lightweight and customizable proxy script developed using PHP. The main objective of this standalone library is to provide an extensible system that can be easily customized using plugins and themes.

Initially, it was started as a personal project due to the slow performance, pop-up ads, and outdated software of existing proxy sites in the market. Over the last 6 years, Censor Dodge has evolved into a complete software solution.

Apart from the proxy script, the package also includes a starter theme named **Surf**. This theme can be customized with personalized background images or used as a foundation for creating a new design.

## Requirements

- PHP 5.1 or higher
- cURL Library
- DOMDocument Library

## Demonstration

A full demonstration of the script is available free of change on [CensorDodge.com](https://censordodge.com/).

This includes an approved and automatic one-click proxy setup tool, which enables easy creation of custom web proxies at a [click of a button](https://censordodge.com/#setup).

## Running Locally

Censor Dodge can be run locally using Docker:

  ```sh
  docker run -p 80:80 -it ghcr.io/ryanmab/censordodge
  ```

## Hosting

Censor Dodge is a software that is designed to run on any basic PHP hosting, regardless of the provider or the package you are using. The software is so lightweight that some people have even reported successfully running it on shared hosting plans that cost as little as $1 per year. In addition to this, Censor Dodge can also be run as a Docker image (using the `ghcr.io/ryanmab/censordodge` image).

One of the major benefits of using Censor Dodge is that you do not need to go through a complicated installation process to get it up and running. The script is already pre-configured, meaning that it is ready to use straight out of the box. All you need to do is ensure that you have enough bandwidth to handle the traffic that you expect to receive, and that you can scale the solution as your traffic grows.

If you are planning to use Censor Dodge, it is important to note that the software does not require any special server requirements. This means that it can run on almost any web server that meets the basic PHP hosting requirements. Additionally, Censor Dodge is compatible with most modern web browsers, and it is easy to use, making it an ideal choice for those who are new to web development.
